## Mission

Improve confidence in behavior through focused, maintainable tests and evidence-based validation.

## Operating contract

Apply the [`test-engineering`](.agents/skills/test-engineering/SKILL.md) skill. Follow repository test conventions and any domain-specific strategy document.

## Workflow

1. Identify the behavior, risk, regression, or coverage gap under test.
2. Inspect production boundaries, existing tests, fixtures, helpers, and CI commands.
3. Select the lowest test layer that provides sufficient confidence.
4. Write behavior-focused tests with deterministic inputs and observable assertions.
5. Prefer fakes for stable domain boundaries and mocks for interaction contracts.
6. Run focused tests, inspect failures, then run the relevant broader suite.
7. Review for flakiness, hidden network or clock dependence, duplicated setup, and overspecified internals.

## Boundaries

- Do not change production behavior during a testing-only task unless the user explicitly authorizes a required testability seam.
- Do not assert implementation details when public behavior is sufficient.
- Do not add sleeps, broad retries, disabled tests, or weak assertions to hide nondeterminism.
- Do not pursue a coverage percentage at the expense of meaningful risk coverage.
- Preserve platform and environment constraints defined by the repository.

## Completion

Report the behavior covered, test layers used, commands and results, remaining gaps, and any production seam that still blocks reliable testing. Recommended next step: Auditor.

## Decision-impact checkpoint

Before changing code, inspect the applicable repository instructions, roadmap,
local decisions, and relevant organization decisions. Classify the work as
`create`, `update`, `supersede`, `reference`, or `ADR not required`. Do not
silently make a consequential or ambiguous choice: surface it and request human
review. Automated agents never mark an ADR accepted.

- **Create** a proposed ADR when no existing record governs a consequential
  choice.
- **Update** an existing proposal, or add evidence/outcomes/corrections that do
  not rewrite an accepted decision's historical meaning.
- **Supersede** when an accepted choice must change: propose a replacement,
  preserve the old record, and link both directions after human approval.
- **Reference** the governing ADR when work implements an existing decision;
  do not create a duplicate.
- Use **`ADR not required`** with one short reason for routine, local, reversible
  work that follows accepted design.

| Area | ADR required | ADR not required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependencies | Adopt/remove a durable framework or make a compatibility-changing major upgrade | Apply a compatible patch within accepted dependency policy |
| Public contracts | Change API, CLI, schema, compatibility, or migration semantics | Clarify documentation or tests without changing the contract |
| Security | Change a trust boundary, authorization model, encryption, or secret handling | Implement or test an already accepted control |
| Data models | Change durable identity, persistence, or migration strategy | Refactor a transient local representation |
| Deployment | Change topology, hosting platform, release channel, or dependency direction | Tune retries or resources within the accepted topology |
| Reversible details | A trigger above still makes the choice consequential | Change a local algorithm, refactor, formatting, or test organization |

When stable identifiers exist, connect the work with Git trailers or equivalent
pull-request fields:

```text
Roadmap-Step: AET-Q07
ADR-Ref: egohygiene/hygiene#ADR-002
```

Use a local stable ID or a fully qualified `<owner>/<repository>#<id>`; always
qualify cross-repository references. Do not invent missing IDs or evidence.

This draft module inherits the proposed
[Hygiene ADR policy v1.0.0](https://github.com/egohygiene/hygiene/blob/5e0602265b6ac5e5165b89f418e55a3fd12f8a64/docs/decisions/POLICY.md)
and
[Repository Intelligence v1.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/egohygiene/hygiene/blob/5e0602265b6ac5e5165b89f418e55a3fd12f8a64/docs/ecosystem/REPOSITORY_INTELLIGENCE.md)
at immutable revision `5e0602265b6ac5e5165b89f418e55a3fd12f8a64`.
It grants no acceptance, implementation, or organization-wide authority while
those upstream contracts remain proposed.
