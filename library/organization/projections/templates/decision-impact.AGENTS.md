## Decision-impact checkpoint

Before changing code, inspect the applicable repository instructions, roadmap,
local decisions, and relevant organization decisions. Classify the work as
`create`, `update`, `supersede`, `reference`, or `ADR not required`. Do not
silently make a consequential or ambiguous choice: surface it and request human
review. Automated agents never mark an ADR accepted.

- **Create** a proposed ADR when no existing record governs a consequential
  choice.
- **Update** an existing proposal, or add evidence/outcomes/corrections that do
  not rewrite an accepted decision's historical meaning.
- **Supersede** when an accepted choice must change: propose a replacement,
  preserve the old record, and link both directions after human approval.
- **Reference** the governing ADR when work implements an existing decision;
  do not create a duplicate.
- Use **`ADR not required`** with one short reason for routine, local, reversible
  work that follows accepted design.

| Area | ADR required | ADR not required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependencies | Adopt/remove a durable framework or make a compatibility-changing major upgrade | Apply a compatible patch within accepted dependency policy |
| Public contracts | Change API, CLI, schema, compatibility, or migration semantics | Clarify documentation or tests without changing the contract |
| Security | Change a trust boundary, authorization model, encryption, or secret handling | Implement or test an already accepted control |
| Data models | Change durable identity, persistence, or migration strategy | Refactor a transient local representation |
| Deployment | Change topology, hosting platform, release channel, or dependency direction | Tune retries or resources within the accepted topology |
| Reversible details | A trigger above still makes the choice consequential | Change a local algorithm, refactor, formatting, or test organization |

When stable identifiers exist, connect the work with Git trailers or equivalent
pull-request fields:

```text
Roadmap-Step: AET-Q07
ADR-Ref: egohygiene/hygiene#ADR-002
```

Use a local stable ID or a fully qualified `<owner>/<repository>#<id>`; always
qualify cross-repository references. Do not invent missing IDs or evidence.

This draft module inherits the proposed
[Hygiene ADR policy v1.0.0](https://github.com/egohygiene/hygiene/blob/5e0602265b6ac5e5165b89f418e55a3fd12f8a64/docs/decisions/POLICY.md)
and
[Repository Intelligence v1.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/egohygiene/hygiene/blob/5e0602265b6ac5e5165b89f418e55a3fd12f8a64/docs/ecosystem/REPOSITORY_INTELLIGENCE.md)
at immutable revision `5e0602265b6ac5e5165b89f418e55a3fd12f8a64`.
It grants no acceptance, implementation, or organization-wide authority while
those upstream contracts remain proposed.
